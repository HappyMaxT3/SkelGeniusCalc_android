Do you often calculate easy number tasks?
So, this calculator will troll you a little :)

Download ```.apk``` on your android phone and start count!

## Functions?

Calculator has a basic functions like summation, subtraction, multiplication and division. There is no specific. The calculator will react to your actions and troll you if the task was too easy. For the calculator, tasks are considered easy if the result is ```result % 100 == 0 ant etc.```, within multiplication table, less than 101 and has no fractional part.

## How it works?

The app was created in ```Android Studio``` using ```Java```. It's a pet project and not intended to be overly serious, which makes fun. 
If you're interested in the code (```Java``` and ```XML```), you should check the files with those respective names in my repository. If you want to create the same app, you just need to copy these files into your project in ```Android Studio```.
